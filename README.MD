 A bit of history

 Polish mathematician, Karol Borsuk, designed Super Farmer in Warsaw, Poland, during the II world war. Originally named 
 “The Animals Herding”, the game was created in 1943. When Germans have closed Polish high schools during the war, 
 professor Borsuk lost his job. Needing money for living, Borsuk conceived a boardgame to increase his family profits. 
 First set created at home by Borsuk’s wife soon gained great popularity among the friends and strangers. Soon the phone 
 at Borsuks’ home ringed often and someone’s voice asked, “Is there animal herder?” “Yes, Badger at the phone,” answered 
 the professor then (the game of words – in English professor’s name means badger). Unfortunately, most copies of the 
 original game were lost during rising in Warsaw in 1944, but the last preserved copies allowed the revival and recover 
 of the nearly extinct design.  
 
 
 The Rules of the Game 
 
 Introduction
 
 You are animal herder, wishing to become a Super Farmer. Your animals breed and herds grows, what brings you profit. 
 You can exchange raised animals for other species if you find this exchange profitable. To become a Super Farmer you 
 must gather livestock including at last one horse, cow, pig, sheep and rabbit. However, be warned! In neighborhood, 
 the wolf and the fox are hunting for your animals. Game setup At the beginning, no one has any animals. Place all the 
 counters in the box. These will make a common stock. 
 
 Breeding 
 
 The game is played in turns taken by subsequent players. 
 On your turn, you roll the dice (both dice are always rolled together). If you get the same animals on both dice 
 (i.e. the same symbols), you receive that animal from the common stock (from the box). After few turns, you can have a 
 few animals. If you have animals in your stock, after roll you receive as many animals from common stock, as many you 
 have full pairs of the same species (including the par on dice).
 
 Examples
 
 1.If you have 6 rabbits and 1 pig, and your rolled rabbit and pig, you receive 3 rabbits and 1 pig (because you have 6 
 rabbit counters and one rabbit symbol on a dice, that is 7 rabbits, so there are 3 complete pairs; 1 pig counter and 
 one pig symbol are one full pair). 
 2.If you have six rabbits and one pig, and your rolled sheep and pig, you receive 1 pig only. 
 3.If you have 5 rabbits and 1 cow and you roll is sheep and pig, you receive nothing. 
 4.If you have 4 rabbits, 2 sheep and 1 horse, and you rolled 2 pigs, you receive 1 pig (as usual, when the symbols on 
 dice doubles). 
 Note: You cannot get a horse or a cow until you exchange some other species for one of these, because only one dice 
 displays the cow and the other one the horse. You can get first horse or cow by exchange only.
 
 Exchange chart
 
 1 sheep = 6 rabbits / 
 1 pig = 2 sheep / 
 1 cow = 3 pigs / 
 1 horse = 2 cows / 
 1 small dog = 1 sheep / 
 1 big dog = 1 cow
 
 Exchanges 
 
 On a very beginning of your turn, before making a roll, you can make one exchange with a common stock or 
 another player. 
 •You can exchange animals with common stock only if there are available animals you wish to obtain; 
 •or you can propose a exchange to fellow player (but she/he can refuse). 
 You must make exchanges according to the table. 
 However, you can exchange many animals for one or vice versa, one animal for few others (if the numbers found in the 
 chart are met). Bidding or other bargains are forbidden. If the common stock is nearly empty, a player making an 
 exchange or having a successful roll receives only as many animals, as there are available in stock. Any rights to 
 missing ones are lost. Example: If you should receive 4 rabbits after a roll, and there are only 3 rabbits in stock, 
 you get last three ones and your turn is over. 
 
 Examples 
 
 1.)Let’s say you have 6 rabbits and 2 cows. There are possible three exchanges: You can swap 6 rabbits for one sheep 
 or two cows for a horse. Alternatively, you can change one cow for 3 pigs. 
 2.)You have 6 rabbits, 1 sheep and 2 pigs. This time you can exchange this stock for one cow (because 6 rabbits give 1 
 sheep, 2 sheep are equal to 1 pig, and a sum of three pigs give 1 cow). 
 3.)If you have one horse, you can, for example, exchange it for 1 cow, 2 pigs and 2 sheep. 
 
 Losing the animals 
 
 If you roll a fox on one of the dice, you lose all the rabbits. Put their counters back into the 
 common stock. If you roll a wolf on other dice, you lose all the animals except horse and small dog (if one of these or 
 both are in your possession). Proceed as above and return the animals to the common stock. 
 
 More examples 
 
 Small dog keeps you safe from the fox. Large dog protects your stock from the effects of wolf. If you roll wolf and 
 fox, and you have small dog, but you do not have large one, you lose all the animals except horse. If you roll a fox 
 and you have small dog, no one animal is lost, but small dog returns to the common stock. If you roll a wolf and you 
 have large dog, no one animal is lost, but large dog returns to the common stock. Note! Large dog does not keep safe 
 from the fox! 
 
 Game ends 
 
 Player, who has in his stock one horse, cow, pig, sheep and rabbit at once, becomes a Super 
 Farmer. Other players may continue the game.
